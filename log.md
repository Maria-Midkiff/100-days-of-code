### Day 5: August 12, 2023

**Today's Progress**: Changed background color to have sounds on each color, uploade to Glitch.

**Link(s) to work**

**Next Actions**: See what is up with Glitch. 

### Day 6: August 13, 2023

**Today's Progress**: Forget glitch. I decided to put the homework on git hub since I watched that video alread. Uploaded background-picker, but the sounds weren't working. Had to create an audio folder and put the four audio files in there, then redo that repository. Created two blog posts and published in hashnode. Tweeted them. 

**Thoughts**:  Be mindful of naming folders and subfolders. May make the CMD line easier.

### Day 9: August 16, 2023

**Today's Progress**: Fighting with Github the entire time. It was referencing the incorrect folder in gitbash. I had deleted a repository, but gitbash was directing to that deleted one. Learned how to see what it was currently referring to and redirecting it. Deployed the Sewing site, and upon reivew, immediately found a problem of course. The tab title needed changing. Tried to change just the index and got gitbash error.
